## About Me

I am research director at the Novak Leadership Institute at the Missouri School of Journalism. My research examines how leadership communication shapes workplace culture and enhances employee engagement and well-being. I also investigate narrative persuasion mechanisms in health communication, exploring how storytelling influences health attitudes and behaviors. I teach at the undergraduate and graduate levels, while mentoring students in their academic and professional development.
